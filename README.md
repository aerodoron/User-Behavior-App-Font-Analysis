# User-Behavior-App-Font-Analysis
The Data in this analysis is from a start up company that sells food products. In this analysis, I will investigate users' behavior for the company's app.  First, I shall study the sales funnel - for example, how many users progress from the first stage to the following stages and how many users complete all stages and purchase products on the app.  Then, I look at the results of an A/A/B test. The app designers of the app wish to alter the app's fonts. However, the product managers are concerned that the new design might deter the app's users. For this reason, the managers decided to make their decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.  The users of the app represented in the Data Frame are split into three separate groups: two control groups who viewed the app with the old fonts (experiment groups 246 and 247) and one test group who viewed the app with the new fonts suggested by the app designers (experiment group 248).  In this analysis we will find out which set of fonts produces better results with the users to help the app's product managers make their decision.  There is a single Data Frame used in this analysis, each log entry in the Data Frame is a user action or an event.
